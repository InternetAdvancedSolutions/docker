* Docker container for Eclim
The purpose of this container, is to provide a containerised eclim
environment.

My use case for this, is so I can more easily use emacs-eclim for
doing Java development within emacs.

This container is based on ~ubuntu:16.04~ and installes ~Eclipse Neon~ and
~eclim 2.5.0~.

** Build the image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker build -t gilesp/eclim .
#+END_SRC

** Running the container
A [[./run-eclimd.sh][shell script]] is provided to simplify running ~eclimd~. 

The script maps the current work directory to be the workspace that
eclimd/eclipse uses. This means that you can have separate eclipse and
eclim configurations for each project.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /path/to/project
run-eclimd.sh
#+END_SRC
